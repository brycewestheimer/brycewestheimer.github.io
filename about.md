## Professional Background

I'm a computational chemist focused on fragment-based *ab initio* methods and the high-performance computing software that makes them practical at scale. I currently split my time between quantum chemistry theory, GPU-ready implementations, and collaborative projects that translate academic advances into tools research labs can deploy.

### Current Appointment

- **Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Colorado Denver (2024 – present)** — Co-advised by Professors Emilie Guidez and Hai Lin, leading method development for multi-layer adaptive partitioning (MAP) and accelerator-aware electronic structure workflows.

### Previous Experience

- **Postdoctoral Research Associate, Ames National Laboratory (2022 – 2024)** — Advanced extreme-scale GAMESS development as part of DOE projects targeting heterogeneous supercomputing architectures.
- **Graduate Research Assistant, Gordon Group · Iowa State University (2015 – 2022)** — Developed rigorous treatments of interfragment covalent bonds, scalable N-orthogonal MO expansions, and contributed to the GAMESS code base.
- **Undergraduate Researcher, Prody Lab · Western Washington University (2014 – 2015)** — Built computational pipelines for structural biology and spectroscopy projects while completing the chemistry curriculum.

### Education

- **Ph.D., Physical Chemistry — Iowa State University (2022)**  
	*Dissertation:* *Developments in fragment-based quantum chemistry: Flattening the curve* (advisor: Mark S. Gordon).
- **B.S., Chemistry — Western Washington University (2015)**
- **A.S., Chemistry — Clark College (2012)**

### Research & Technical Expertise

- **Fragment-based & partitioned quantum chemistry** — MAP, adaptive QM/MM, subsystem-local SAPT, and embedding strategies that balance accuracy with scalability.
- **High-performance computing** — MPI/OpenMP hybrids, GPU acceleration, and performance engineering for emerging accelerator-driven architectures.
- **Electronic structure software** — Core GAMESS development plus open-source libraries such as [`libfrag`](https://github.com/brycewestheimer/libfrag), `public_libaccefp`, and `public_libaccsapt`.
- **Programming toolkit** — Fortran, C++, Python, CUDA, CMake, Git, and modern CI workflows for science codes.

### Recognition & Fellowships

- Molecular Sciences Software Institute (MolSSI) Software Fellow, 2020–2021 cohort.
- Klaus Ruedenberg Theoretical Chemistry Award, Iowa State University.

### Presentations & Community Engagement

- ACS Fall 2024 PHYS Division talk: *Subsystem-local resolution of the identity: Novel methods for exchange repulsion effects in intermolecular interaction methods*.
- Session presider for "Addressing the Complexity of Correlated Quantum Many-Body Problems by Embedding & Downfolding" at ACS Fall 2024.
- Regular contributor to Guidez and Lin group seminars, with additional posters and invited talks on MAP-based methods.

### Beyond the Lab

Open science and mentorship are core to my work. I maintain public repositories whenever possible, support early-career researchers adopting GAMESS-derived tooling, and enjoy collaborating with interdisciplinary teams across chemistry, applied math, and computer science.
