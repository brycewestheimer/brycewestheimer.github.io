# Development Handoff – 2025-10-16

## Status at a Glance
- **Milestones:** M1 (Data collection) ✅ · M2 (Content rewrite) ✅ · M3 (Metadata alignment) ⬇️ next · M4 (Review & publish) not started.
- **Source of truth:** Verified facts and citations live in `notes/milestone1-sources.md` with a CV snapshot in `notes/bryce-westheimer-cv-snapshot.md`.
- **Live content:** `about.md`, `research.md`, `contact.md`, `projects.md`, and `publications.md` now match the verified data set and are ready for metadata and navigation updates.

## Recent Work Completed (since 2025-10-15)
- Gathered remaining biographical data (roles, education, awards, talks) and logged citations; marked all M1 checklist items complete.
- Rewrote the five primary public-facing pages with accurate narratives, collaboration notes, and project details; closed every M2 checklist item.
- Confirmed the site builds cleanly with `bundle exec jekyll build` (Faraday retry advisory and GitHub metadata warning remain expected without credentials).
- Updated `TODO.md` milestones and changelog to reflect finished work through M2.

## Focus for Upcoming Session (Milestone M3 – Metadata Alignment)
1. **Global config:** Update `_config.yml` author block (name, title, email, location, bio blurb) and any SEO/description fields to mirror the new copy.
2. **Data files:** Refresh `_data/social_media.yml` and related lists with verified handles; prune unused platforms.
3. **Includes & navigation:** Audit `_includes/masthead.html`, `navigation.html`, `interests.html`, and other shared snippets for outdated phrases; adjust nav ordering if needed.
4. **Branding & assets:** Spot-check `_data/colors.json`, favicon references, and `assets/styles.scss` for consistency with current palette (optional but earmarked in TODO).
5. **Metadata QA:** Verify Open Graph/Twitter card descriptions, site title, and feed metadata align with the refreshed pages.

## Supporting References
- Publications and talks: Crossref/dblp DOIs plus ACS session links listed in `notes/milestone1-sources.md`.
- Projects: GitHub repositories `libfrag`, `public_libaccefp`, `public_libaccsapt`, `public_qccg` documented with API snapshots (2025-10-16).
- Contact & social: Personal site footer, Google Scholar profile (`gnELDysAAAAJ`), and RocketReach-derived CV details.

## Environment & Tooling
- Ruby 3.2.9 (x64) installed at `C:\Ruby32-x64`; prepend its `bin` directory to `PATH` before running Bundler.
- Bundler installs gems into `vendor/bundle` (ignored by Git). Use the usual workflow:
	```powershell
	$env:Path = "C:\Ruby32-x64\bin;" + $env:Path
	bundle install
	bundle exec jekyll build
	```
- `bundle exec jekyll build` outputs the Faraday retry advisory and missing GitHub auth warning—both informational.

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Execute the M3 checklist items above, committing logical batches (config/data updates, include clean-up, etc.).
2. Re-run `bundle exec jekyll build` after metadata changes and skim `_site/` outputs for nav/SEO correctness.
3. Capture any new observations in `TODO.md` and extend the changelog once M3 wraps.
4. Start drafting an M4 readiness checklist (proofreading, link validation, deployment) as metadata tasks complete.

Prepared for the upcoming session—this handoff supersedes the 2025-10-16 draft and should be shared with the next contributor before beginning Milestone M3.
# Development Handoff – 2025-10-16

## Current Status
- Repository working tree is clean; all recent changes are committed.
- Milestone tracking lives in `TODO.md`. Milestone M1 (data collection) is partially complete: publications, project inventory, contact channels, and social handles are verified; résumé, education history, and award data still need sourcing.
- Jekyll site builds locally with `bundle exec jekyll build` after installing the Ruby 3.2 toolchain, MSYS2 components, and the `tzinfo-data` gem.
- `.gitignore` now ignores `vendor/` and `InstallationLog.txt`, so Bundler’s install artifacts stay out of version control.

## Recent Work Completed
- Installed Ruby 3.2.9 (x64) plus the MSYS2/MINGW toolchain via `ridk` to satisfy native gem dependencies.
- Added `tzinfo-data` to `Gemfile` (targeting `:windows` and `:jruby`) to resolve the Windows timezone data error.
- Ran `bundle install` and `bundle exec jekyll build`; the build now finishes successfully (standard GitHub metadata warning persists until credentials are wired up).
- Updated the Review & Deployment checklist in `TODO.md` and logged the environment setup in the change log.

## Outstanding Work & Milestone Focus
- **Finish M1 data collection:** gather résumé/CV, title/employer/location, full education timeline, research area summaries, and any awards or service highlights.
- **Kick off M2 content rewrite:** prioritize rewriting `about.md` and `research.md` once missing biographical data is in hand; follow with `projects.md`, `contact.md`, and `publications.md` to align with the verified sources.
- **Future milestones:** M3 (metadata alignment) and M4 (QA/deployment) depend on the rewritten content; no action needed yet beyond keeping notes of required metadata changes.

## Environment & Tooling Notes
- Ruby is installed at `C:\Ruby32-x64`. Ensure the session PATH includes `C:\Ruby32-x64\bin` before running Bundler.
- Bundler installs gems into `vendor/bundle`; this folder is ignored in Git.
- Typical local workflow:

```powershell
$env:Path = "C:\Ruby32-x64\bin;$env:Path"
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll build
# For live preview:
bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload
```

- `bundle exec jekyll build` emits a Faraday retry advisory and a GitHub metadata warning; both are informational and expected for local runs without API credentials.

## Suggested Next Steps for the Follow-up Session
1. Collect the remaining biographical data (résumé, education, awards) and update `notes/milestone1-sources.md` with citations.
2. Mark the outstanding items in `TODO.md` once sources are confirmed to close out Milestone M1.
3. Draft the refreshed `about.md` and `research.md` content using the verified data; keep tone consistent with the rest of the site.
4. Re-run `bundle exec jekyll build` after each major content update to ensure the site stays stable.
5. Note any metadata tweaks needed during rewriting so they can be tackled systematically in M3.

Prepared for the next development session—feel free to start a new chat when you’re ready to dive into Milestone M2.
