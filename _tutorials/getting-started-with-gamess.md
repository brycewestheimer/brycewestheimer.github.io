# Getting Started with GAMESS for Quantum Chemistry Calculations

GAMESS (General Atomic and Molecular Electronic Structure System) is one of the most widely used quantum chemistry software packages. This tutorial will guide you through setting up and running your first calculations.

## What You'll Learn

By the end of this tutorial, you'll be able to:
- Set up GAMESS input files
- Run basic Hartree-Fock calculations
- Interpret basic output results
- Optimize molecular geometries

## Prerequisites

Before starting this tutorial, make sure you have:
- GAMESS installed on your system
- Basic understanding of quantum chemistry concepts
- Familiarity with text editors and command line

## Step 1: Understanding GAMESS Input Structure

GAMESS input files have a specific structure with different sections:

```fortran
 $CONTRL SCFTYP=RHF RUNTYP=ENERGY $END
 $BASIS GBASIS=STO NGAUSS=3 $END
 $DATA
Water molecule - STO-3G calculation
C1
O    8.0   0.0   0.0   0.0
H    1.0   0.757  0.0   0.587
H    1.0  -0.757  0.0   0.587
 $END
```

### Key Sections Explained:

- **$CONTRL**: Controls the type of calculation
- **$BASIS**: Defines the basis set
- **$DATA**: Contains molecular geometry

## Step 2: Your First Calculation

Let's start with a simple water molecule energy calculation...

## Next Steps

Once you're comfortable with basic calculations, try:
- Geometry optimization (RUNTYP=OPTIMIZE)
- Frequency calculations (RUNTYP=HESSIAN)
- Different basis sets (6-31G, cc-pVDZ)

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **Convergence problems**: Try different initial guesses
- **Memory errors**: Adjust MWORDS in $SYSTEM
- **Basis set errors**: Check element symbols and coordinates
